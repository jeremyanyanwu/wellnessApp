        <p>Picture this: An AI that analyzes your moods like a therapist on caffeineâ€” "Your stress is high because you studied for 3 hours on an empty stomach. Solution: Eat a snack and call it 'self-care.'"</p>
        <p>Or: "Your sleep score is 4/10. That's not a nap; that's a cry for coffee. We'll fix that with trends that actually work (no, 'just sleep more' doesn't count)."</p>
        <p>Stay tuned for wellness wisdom that'll make you laugh... or cry. Either way, it's progress! ðŸ˜„ðŸ§ </p>
